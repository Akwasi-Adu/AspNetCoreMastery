        <h2>A Brief History</h2>

        <p>
          To understand C# and .NET, we need to travel back to the late 1990s. Microsoft was 
          watching the explosive growth of Java—a language that promised "write once, run anywhere." 
          Java code could run on Windows, Mac, Linux, and more, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
        </p>

        <p>
          Microsoft needed an answer. They wanted a modern, object-oriented language that could:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Compete with Java's productivity and safety</li>
          <li>Work seamlessly with Windows and their growing web technologies</li>
          <li>Be easier to use than C++, which was powerful but notoriously complex</li>
          <li>Support the future of web services and distributed computing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The result was a two-part solution announced in 2000:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>C#</strong> (pronounced "C-sharp") — A new programming language</li>
          <li><strong>.NET Framework</strong> — A platform for running C# (and other languages)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          The lead architect of C# was <strong>Anders Hejlsberg</strong>, who had previously created 
          Turbo Pascal and was the chief architect of Delphi—two of the most beloved development tools 
          of their era. His experience shows in C#'s design: it's pragmatic, readable, and 
          developer-friendly.
        </p>

        <div class="callout callout-info">
          <div class="callout-title">ℹ️ Why "C-Sharp"?</div>
          <p>
            The name comes from music notation, where a "sharp" (♯) raises a note by a half step. 
            It's a play on C++, where "++" is an operator that increments a value. So C# is 
            symbolically "C++ incremented" or "C++ improved." The # symbol was chosen because 
            it's easier to type than ♯.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Understanding .NET: The Platform</h2>

        <p>
          Here's a critical distinction that confuses many beginners: <strong>C# is a language; 
          .NET is a platform</strong>. They're closely related but different things.
        </p>

        <div class="analogy">
          Think of it like this: C# is the language you speak, and .NET is the country where 
          that language is understood. You write your instructions in C#, but .NET provides 
          the infrastructure to actually execute them—the runtime, the libraries, the tools.
        </div>

        <p>
          .NET consists of several key components:
        </p>

        <h3>1. The Common Language Runtime (CLR)</h3>

        <p>
          The <span class="term">CLR</span> is the heart of .NET. It's the "virtual machine" that 
          actually runs your code. When you hear ".NET Runtime," this is what people usually mean.
        </p>

        <p>
          The CLR provides crucial services:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Memory Management</dt>
          <dd>
            The CLR automatically allocates and frees memory for your objects. You don't need 
            to manually manage memory like in C or C++. This is called <span class="term">garbage collection</span>.
          </dd>

          <dt>Type Safety</dt>
          <dd>
            The CLR enforces that you use data types correctly. You can't accidentally treat 
            a number as text or access memory you shouldn't.
          </dd>

          <dt>Exception Handling</dt>
          <dd>
            When errors occur, the CLR provides a structured way to catch and handle them 
            instead of your program crashing mysteriously.
          </dd>

          <dt>Security</dt>
          <dd>
            The CLR enforces security boundaries, preventing malicious code from accessing 
            system resources it shouldn't.
          </dd>

          <dt>JIT Compilation</dt>
          <dd>
            The CLR compiles your intermediate code to machine code right before execution, 
            optimizing it for the specific computer it's running on.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>2. The Base Class Library (BCL)</h3>

        <p>
          The <span class="term">Base Class Library</span> is a massive collection of pre-written code 
          that you can use in your programs. Why write code to read a file, make a web request, 
          or format a date when Microsoft has already written (and tested) that code for you?
        </p>

        <p>
          The BCL includes:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>System.IO</strong> — File and stream operations</li>
          <li><strong>System.Collections</strong> — Lists, dictionaries, queues, stacks</li>
          <li><strong>System.Net</strong> — Networking and HTTP</li>
          <li><strong>System.Text</strong> — String manipulation, encoding, regular expressions</li>
          <li><strong>System.Threading</strong> — Parallel and concurrent programming</li>
          <li><strong>System.Linq</strong> — Querying data (we'll cover this extensively)</li>
          <li>...and hundreds more</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When you write a C# program, you're constantly using the BCL, often without realizing it. 
          Even something as simple as <code>Console.WriteLine("Hello")</code> uses the BCL's 
          <code>System.Console</code> class.
        </p>

        <h3>3. The SDK (Software Development Kit)</h3>

        <p>
          The <span class="term">.NET SDK</span> is what you install on your computer to <em>develop</em> 
          .NET applications. It includes:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>The C# compiler</li>
          <li>The runtime (CLR)</li>
          <li>The base class libraries</li>
          <li>Command-line tools (<code>dotnet</code> CLI)</li>
          <li>Project templates</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When you "install .NET," you're typically installing the SDK.
        </p>

        <h3>4. The Runtime (Standalone)</h3>

        <p>
          The <span class="term">.NET Runtime</span> is a smaller package that only includes what's 
          needed to <em>run</em> .NET applications (not develop them). This is what you'd install 
          on a server that needs to host your application but where no development happens.
        </p>

        <div class="callout callout-concept">
          <div class="callout-title">💡 SDK vs Runtime</div>
          <p>
            <strong>SDK</strong> = Everything for development (includes Runtime)<br>
            <strong>Runtime</strong> = Only what's needed to run apps<br><br>
            As a developer, always install the SDK. The runtime is for production servers 
            or end-user machines.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>The .NET Evolution: A Confusing History Made Clear</h2>

        <p>
          One of the most confusing things about .NET is its versioning history. Let me clarify 
          this once and for all, because you'll encounter these terms in the wild.
        </p>

        <h3>.NET Framework (2002-2019) — The Original</h3>

        <p>
          The original .NET Framework ran <strong>only on Windows</strong>. For almost two decades, 
          if you wanted to run C# code on Linux or Mac, you were out of luck (mostly).
        </p>

        <p>
          .NET Framework versions went from 1.0 up to 4.8. Many enterprise applications still 
          run on .NET Framework 4.8, and Microsoft continues to support it—but no new features 
          are being added.
        </p>

        <h3>.NET Core (2016-2020) — The Revolution</h3>

        <p>
          In 2016, Microsoft did something remarkable: they rewrote .NET from scratch and made 
          it <strong>open-source and cross-platform</strong>. This was called .NET Core.
        </p>

        <p>
          .NET Core could run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It was faster, more modular, and 
          designed for modern cloud and container workloads. Versions went from 1.0 to 3.1.
        </p>

        <h3>.NET 5, 6, 7, 8... (2020-Present) — The Unification</h3>

        <p>
          In 2020, Microsoft unified everything under the simple name ".NET" (dropping both 
          "Framework" and "Core"). They skipped version 4 to avoid confusion with .NET Framework 4.x.
        </p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Version</th>
              <th>Release</th>
              <th>Support Type</th>
              <th>Notes</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>.NET 5</td>
              <td>Nov 2020</td>
              <td>Standard (ended)</td>
              <td>First unified .NET</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>.NET 6</td>
              <td>Nov 2021</td>
              <td>LTS (ended Nov 2024)</td>
              <td>Long-term support</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>.NET 7</td>
              <td>Nov 2022</td>
              <td>Standard (ended)</td>
              <td>Short-term support</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>.NET 8</strong></td>
              <td>Nov 2023</td>
              <td><strong>LTS (until Nov 2026)</strong></td>
              <td><strong>← We'll use this!</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>.NET 9</td>
              <td>Nov 2024</td>
              <td>Standard</td>
              <td>Latest features</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          <strong>LTS</strong> (Long-Term Support) versions are supported for 3 years and are 
          recommended for production applications. <strong>Standard</strong> versions get 18 months 
          of support and contain the newest features.
        </p>

        <div class="callout callout-tip">
          <div class="callout-title">💡 Which Version to Use?</div>
          <p>
            For this guide and your professional work, use <strong>.NET 8</strong>. It's the 
            current LTS version, meaning it's stable, well-supported, and what most companies 
            are adopting for new projects. All examples in this guide will use .NET 8.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>What About ASP.NET?</h3>

        <p>
          You might be wondering where ASP.NET fits in. Here's the quick breakdown:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>ASP.NET (Original)</dt>
          <dd>
            The web framework that ran on .NET Framework. Included Web Forms, MVC, Web API, 
            and SignalR. Windows-only.
          </dd>

          <dt>ASP.NET Core</dt>
          <dd>
            The modern, cross-platform rewrite of ASP.NET that runs on .NET Core / .NET 5+. 
            This is what we'll be learning. It's faster, more flexible, and the future of 
            .NET web development.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
          When we say "ASP.NET Core Mastery," we mean building web applications using ASP.NET Core 
          on modern .NET (version 8 in our case).
        </p>

        <h2>How C# Code Becomes a Running Program</h2>

        <p>
          Let's trace the journey from the code you write to the program that runs. Understanding 
          this process helps demystify error messages and debugging.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1: You Write Source Code</h3>

        <p>
          You create files with the <code>.cs</code> extension containing C# code:
        </p>

        <div class="code-header">
          <span class="code-filename">Program.cs</span>
          <span class="code-language">C#</span>
        </div>
        <pre><code><span class="code-keyword">using</span> System;

<span class="code-keyword">class</span> <span class="code-class">Program</span>
{
    <span class="code-keyword">static</span> <span class="code-keyword">void</span> <span class="code-method">Main</span>()
    {
        Console.<span class="code-method">WriteLine</span>(<span class="code-string">"Hello, World!"</span>);
    }
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          This is human-readable text. The computer can't run it yet.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2: The C# Compiler Creates IL</h3>

        <p>
          When you build your project, the C# compiler (<code>csc.exe</code> or <code>Roslyn</code>) 
          reads your source code and produces <span class="term">Intermediate Language (IL)</span>, 
          also called MSIL or CIL.
        </p>

        <p>
          IL is a CPU-independent instruction set. It's not machine code yet, but it's much 
          lower-level than C#. Here's roughly what our "Hello World" looks like in IL:
        </p>

        <div class="code-header">
          <span class="code-filename">output</span>
          <span class="code-language">IL (Intermediate Language)</span>
        </div>
        <pre><code>.method private hidebysig static void Main() cil managed
{
    .entrypoint
    .maxstack 1
    
    ldstr "Hello, World!"
    call void [System.Console]System.Console::WriteLine(string)
    ret
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          You'll never need to write or read IL directly, but knowing it exists helps you 
          understand what's happening under the hood.
        </p>

        <p>
          The IL code is packaged into an <span class="term">assembly</span>—either a 
          <code>.dll</code> (Dynamic Link Library) or <code>.exe</code> (Executable) file.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3: The CLR JIT-Compiles to Machine Code</h3>

        <p>
          When you run your program, the CLR's <span class="term">JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler</span> 
          converts the IL to native machine code for your specific processor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why not compile directly to machine code like C++? Because IL enables powerful features:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cross-platform</strong>: The same IL runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac—the JIT 
              produces the right machine code for each</li>
          <li><strong>Optimization</strong>: The JIT can optimize for the specific CPU at runtime</li>
          <li><strong>Security</strong>: The CLR can verify IL is safe before executing it</li>
          <li><strong>Language interop</strong>: C#, F#, and VB.NET all compile to IL, so they 
              can work together seamlessly</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="analogy">
          Think of IL like a universal recipe written in metric measurements. When you cook it 
          (run it), the JIT "translates" to whatever measuring system your kitchen uses 
          (your specific CPU architecture). The recipe stays the same, but the final conversion 
          happens in your kitchen.
        </div>

        <h2>C# as a Language: Key Characteristics</h2>

        <p>
          Now that you understand the platform, let's look at C# itself. What kind of language is it?
        </p>

        <h3>Statically Typed</h3>

        <p>
          In C#, every variable has a specific type, and that type is checked at <em>compile time</em>. 
          This catches many errors before your code even runs.
        </p>

        <div class="code-header">
          <span class="code-filename">example.cs</span>
          <span class="code-language">C#</span>
        </div>
        <pre><code><span class="code-type">int</span> <span class="code-variable">age</span> = <span class="code-number">25</span>;           <span class="code-comment">// age is an integer</span>
<span class="code-type">string</span> <span class="code-variable">name</span> = <span class="code-string">"Akwasi"</span>;   <span class="code-comment">// name is text</span>

age = <span class="code-string">"twenty-five"</span>;      <span class="code-comment">// ERROR! Can't assign text to an integer</span></code></pre>

        <p>
          Compare this to Python (dynamically typed), where the same variable can hold 
          different types at different times. Static typing adds safety but requires you 
          to be explicit about what kind of data you're working with.
        </p>

        <h3>Object-Oriented</h3>

        <p>
          C# is built around the concept of <span class="term">objects</span>—bundles of data 
          and behavior. Everything in C# is either an object or belongs to an object. We'll 
          explore this deeply in the OOP section.
        </p>

        <h3>Memory-Managed</h3>

        <p>
          Unlike C or C++, you don't manually allocate and free memory. The garbage collector 
          handles this automatically. This prevents entire categories of bugs (memory leaks, 
          use-after-free) at the cost of occasional garbage collection pauses.
        </p>

        <h3>Modern and Evolving</h3>

        <p>
          C# is actively developed. New versions add features like pattern matching, records, 
          nullable reference types, and more. The language has evolved dramatically from version 
          1.0 to the current version (12 as of .NET 8), always staying modern and competitive.
        </p>

        <h2>Setting Up Your Development Environment</h2>

        <p>
          Let's get your computer ready for C# development. We'll install Visual Studio 2022, 
          which includes everything you need.
        </p>

        <h3>Installing Visual Studio 2022</h3>

        <div class="callout callout-info">
          <div class="callout-title">ℹ️ Why Visual Studio?</div>
          <p>
            Visual Studio is Microsoft's flagship IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for 
            .NET development. The Community Edition is free for individuals, students, and small 
            teams. It provides the best C# development experience with IntelliSense, debugging, 
            refactoring tools, and seamless integration with .NET.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Follow these steps:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Go to <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/" target="_blank">
            visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Download <strong>Visual Studio 2022 Community</strong> (the free version)
          </li>
          <li>
            Run the installer. When prompted to select workloads, check:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>ASP.NET and web development</strong> (essential for our goals)</li>
              <li><strong>.NET desktop development</strong> (useful for console apps and learning)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Click Install and wait (this may take a while—it's a large download)
          </li>
          <li>
            Once installed, launch Visual Studio and sign in with a Microsoft account (or skip)
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Verifying the Installation</h3>

        <p>
          Let's confirm everything is working by checking the .NET SDK version. Open a 
          <strong>Command Prompt</strong> or <strong>PowerShell</strong> and type:
        </p>

        <div class="code-header">
          <span class="code-filename">terminal</span>
          <span class="code-language">Command Line</span>
        </div>
        <pre><code>dotnet --version</code></pre>

        <p>
          You should see output like:
        </p>

        <div class="code-header">
          <span class="code-filename">output</span>
          <span class="code-language">Command Line</span>
        </div>
        <pre><code>8.0.100</code></pre>

        <p>
          The exact version may differ, but as long as it starts with <code>8.</code>, you're 
          using .NET 8.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can also see all installed SDKs:
        </p>

        <div class="code-header">
          <span class="code-filename">terminal</span>
          <span class="code-language">Command Line</span>
        </div>
        <pre><code>dotnet --list-sdks</code></pre>

        <h3>Creating Your First Project (Quick Test)</h3>

        <p>
          Let's create a quick project to verify everything works. We'll do this properly in 
          later sections, but here's a quick test:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Open Visual Studio 2022</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Create a new project</strong></li>
          <li>Search for "Console" and select <strong>Console App</strong> (make sure it says 
              "C#" and not "Visual Basic")</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Next</strong></li>
          <li>Name your project <code>HelloWorld</code> and choose a location</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Next</strong></li>
          <li>Ensure <strong>.NET 8.0</strong> is selected in the Framework dropdown</li>
          <li>Click <strong>Create</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Visual Studio will create a project with a single file containing:
        </p>

        <div class="code-header">
          <span class="code-filename">Program.cs</span>
          <span class="code-language">C#</span>
        </div>
        <pre><code><span class="code-comment">// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information</span>
Console.<span class="code-method">WriteLine</span>(<span class="code-string">"Hello, World!"</span>);</code></pre>

        <p>
          Press <strong>F5</strong> (or click the green "Start" button). A console window should 
          appear showing "Hello, World!" — and then immediately close.
        </p>

        <div class="callout callout-tip">
          <div class="callout-title">💡 Keep the Console Open</div>
          <p>
            To keep the console window open after the program finishes, press <strong>Ctrl+F5</strong> 
            instead of F5. This runs without the debugger and adds a "Press any key to continue" prompt.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Congratulations! You've just compiled and run your first C# program. 🎉
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding the Modern C# Template</h2>

        <p>
          You might have noticed the code was surprisingly short—just one line. That's because 
          .NET 6+ introduced <span class="term">top-level statements</span>, which remove the 
          ceremonial boilerplate for simple programs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Behind the scenes, the compiler wraps your code in the traditional structure. These 
          two programs are equivalent:
        </p>

        <div class="code-header">
          <span class="code-filename">Modern (Top-level statements)</span>
          <span class="code-language">C#</span>
        </div>
        <pre><code>Console.<span class="code-method">WriteLine</span>(<span class="code-string">"Hello, World!"</span>);</code></pre>

        <div class="code-header">
          <span class="code-filename">Traditional (Explicit structure)</span>
          <span class="code-language">C#</span>
        </div>
        <pre><code><span class="code-keyword">using</span> System;

<span class="code-keyword">namespace</span> <span class="code-class">HelloWorld</span>
{
    <span class="code-keyword">class</span> <span class="code-class">Program</span>
    {
        <span class="code-keyword">static</span> <span class="code-keyword">void</span> <span class="code-method">Main</span>(<span class="code-type">string</span>[] <span class="code-variable">args</span>)
        {
            Console.<span class="code-method">WriteLine</span>(<span class="code-string">"Hello, World!"</span>);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          We'll use top-level statements for simple examples (they reduce noise while learning), 
          but you'll also learn the traditional structure because real-world applications use it.
        </p>
